Table 1 in Verlet July 1967

Rapaport units: rho = 0.85: T = 0.88: beta*P/rho = 1.64

In physical units: rho = 0.02153atoms/AA^3: T = 105.424K: P = 507.2atm


Verlet run with 864 atoms and cutoff 2.5*3.405AA=8.5125AA


Here run with fcc 8x8x8 and cutoff 10.5125 and got the following P = 686 - 170 = 516atm +- 28atm

which is very good agreement
