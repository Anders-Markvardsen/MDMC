Using ordinary Makefiles: 
1) make sure xmlf90_sax library is compiled first by going to 
trunk/src/xmlf90_sax/sax and using linux type 'make' and under windows type 
'nmake -f windows-makefile'.
2) go to the trunk/src directory. Type 'make' under linux and
'nmake -f windows-makefile' under windows.

Using SCONS makefiles:
1) go to the trunk/src directory and type 'scons'. You may have to edit the 
SConstruct file first so that only the library is build to start with.
